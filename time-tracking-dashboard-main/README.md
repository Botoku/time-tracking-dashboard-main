## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript 

### What I learned

Apart from getting more familiar with CSS grid I also learnt and became more familiar with fetching data from an external source and how to manipulate said data into the browser window. In the javascript to display the appropriate content based on the user clicks i learnt how to manipulate nodelists from 'query selector all' with forEach and this was really helpful as it saved having to write a lot of repetitive code.
